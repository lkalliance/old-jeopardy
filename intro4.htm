We edited a lot of them, and took inspiration from a lot more to form similar questions. Each question in the game that was provided by a Ringnut or that was inspired by a Ringnut's suggestion is credited. Those questions that are not specifically credited were created by our Questions Committee to fill in specific spots in the question grid.<br><br>Had enough of my disclaimers and babbling? So have I. I hope you have as much fun watching as I've had putting it together.<br><br>&mdash;Elkie<br><br><b><a href=http://game.ringnutjeopardy.com>Let's play Ringnut Jeopardy!</a></b><br><br></font></td></tr><tr><td height=1 bgcolor=#000088></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Verdana size=4 color=#8888cc><b><br>THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE.</b></font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Verdana size=2><br><br><a href="http://us.1.p4.webhosting.yahoo.com/gb/sign?member=ringnutjeopardy">Sign our guestbook</a> | <a href="http://us.1.p4.webhosting.yahoo.com/gb/view?member=ringnutjeopardy">View our guestbook</a><br>Questions?
