I'd like to thank most particularly our bookmaker <b>Dr. Prunesquallor</b>; our field reporters <b>Rosie</b>, <b>Faramiria</b>, <b>Bellbird</b> and <b>Sir Big V</b>; our timer, <b>Minky_9</b>; and of course I want to thank you, the Ringnuts, for your question submissions. We received hundreds of submissions! Thank you!<br><br>Most of all I owe a huge debt of gratitude to the Questions Committee of <b>Athene</b>, <b>Gimlet-son-of-Groin</b> and <b>Wajz-the-White</b>. They had the huge task of not only collecting your submissions and checking them for accuracy, brainstorming on topics and questions, and keeping track of the evolving grid; they also had to put up with my constant editorial meddling. It's never easy to work that hard and then see a control-freak producer rewrite most of your questions. But they handled it with grace and aplomb.<br><br><a href=http://www.ringnutjeopardy.com>Take me back to the home page</a><br><br></font></td></tr><tr><td height=1 bgcolor=#000088></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Verdana size=4 color=#8888cc><b><br>THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE.</b></font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=Verdana size=2><br><br><a href="http://us.1.p4.webhosting.yahoo.com/gb/sign?member=ringnutjeopardy">Sign our guestbook</a> | <a href="http://us.1.p4.webhosting.yahoo.com/gb/view?member=ringnutjeopardy">View our guestbook</a><br>Questions?
